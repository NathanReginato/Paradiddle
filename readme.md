### The search for perfect time

Paradiddle is and app I created for musicians. I have played drums for eight years and have taught drums for two years. I always had trouble with teaching my students how to improve their time. Time is an integral part of drumming, it's usually an uncomfortable experience to listen to a drummer with "bad" time. This got me thinking, what if I could make an app to show my students that they are off time and how far off time they are? That's when I had the idea for Paradiddle.

### The app

Paradiddle takes real time data from your browser and writes it to a graph. "Perfect time" is displayed as the bars of the metronome and the players time is displayed as sound waves on the graph. The distance between the two displays the difference between your time, and "perfect time".

### What is a paradiddle?

Just in case you didn't know, [<i>"it is an absolutely essential rudiment for any drummer that wants to expand their drumming possibilities. The single paradiddle is a combination of single strokes and double strokes."</i>](http://www.freedrumlessons.com/drum-lessons/single-paradiddle.php)
